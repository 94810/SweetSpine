Foreword - SweetSpine is a serious game for both back-pain prevention and cure. The serious part of the game is hidden and we want our users to play this game as a fun game but do moves that are good for their back at the same time. 

Target Audience - Anyone who can bend!

Challenges of the Game -  Memory, Observance power and Puzzle solving skills in general

Medical Targets - Achieve a reduction in only back-pain for the users.
 
BackPain has been a major health problem and statistics show that 8 out of every 10 Americans will experience backpain at one point or other in their life. We at Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity summer school are students from different backgrounds and countries and 5 of us thought why not try to tackle this problem this summer? And Voila, we have for you
Sweet Spine!

We worked on our project for 4 weeks from mid July till mid August. We will first try to describe the breakdown of our project week wise and then write instructions on how to use the Game.

Week 1 - The gameplay, users, tools and resources required etc were decided in this week. We have another link that we uploaded during the week https://github.com/94810/SweetSpine/blob/master/doc/brainstorm1.txt. We did some research on back-pain and contacted some mentors. In terms of research we read some papers previously published on backpain prevention and also looked at some existing apps and games for preventing back-pain. We made it clear that we wanted to create a fun game and not a tutorial for back-pain. We contacted Koondal which is a French startup for ... But we do not have medical verification for our moves in the game which is a roadblock to be solved. We required a sensor, VR board and a game engine for our project. For the Game Engine we chose unity. For the VR we chose Google's Cardboard VR and for sensor we choose a Movuino which a product of CRI developed by Kevin LHoste. We used some libraries in unity that are created for Movuino at CRI itself. So our final project is a puzzle based game for backpain that uses VR and movuino.

Week 2-4 - We made three levels for the game. We went ahead with our plans of the first week and completed a presentable game by 4-8-17.

Instructions for the Game:

It is a point and click game, the gameplay involves a Movuino and a VR. The Movuino has to placed at the back of the body and strapped tightly because the sensor is sensitive, and the VR can be a simple cardboard VR. See images below for furthur details.
