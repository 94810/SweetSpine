## Foreword

SweetSpine is a serious game for both back-pain prevention and cure. The serious part of the game is hidden and we want our users to play this game as a fun game but do moves that are good for their back at the same time.
BackPain has been a major health problem and statistics show that 8 out of every 10 Americans will experience back pain at one point or other in their life. We at Centre for Research and Interdisciplinary summer school are students from different backgrounds and countries and 5 of us thought why not try to tackle this problem this summer? And Voila, we have for you
Sweet Spine!

## Gameplay

Gameplay is a point and click game and the user has to click the tab on the VR to move, pick or drop objects. The main back pain move comes as a gameplay to change environments.
