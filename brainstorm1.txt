Subject : 
- choose a type of game
- what are we going to present as a proof of concept
- define work for everybody

GAME STYLE
limitations : VR cardboard + 1 button + 1 movuino

point & click game : keeps the game slow, time to think, inventory (Sherlock Holmes inner palace?)
gameplay :
	- flow of different move (3 or 4) to interact with objects in
the room (~ a dance)
	- 1 or 2 moves to change the environment

The player is rewarded when the move is correct, penalized otherwise.

What is an environment : same room but not the same configuration
(in the past / future ? other dimension ?)

Should we implement a tree story instead of having an AI ?
Should we have a warm up ? It could be used as a calibration time too. (ex : walking in a forest and avoid branches)

Puzzle idea : 
 - LIFO inventory
 - enigma
 - riddles

 PROOF OF CONCEPT
 - simple story (why the characters, location, quest) with drawings to illustrate (Gaspard)
 - 1 puzzle to solve -> swap exercice (Julien)
 - 1 room with 3 environments (Pablo, Aymeric)
 - 1 or 2 easy move with the movuino (Shivam, Mai Line)
