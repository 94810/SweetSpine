#Log Book

We worked on our project for four weeks from mid July till mid August. We will first try to describe the breakdown of our project week wise and then write instructions on how to use the Game.

##Week 1

The gameplay, users, tools and resources required etc were decided in this week. We have another link that we uploaded during the week https://github.com/94810/SweetSpine/blob/master/doc/brainstorm1.txt. We did some research on back-pain and contacted some mentors. In terms of research we read some papers previously published on back pain prevention and also looked at some existing apps and games for preventing back-pain. We made it clear that we wanted to create a fun game and not a tutorial for back-pain. We contacted Koondal which is a French startup for ... But we do not have medical verification for our moves in the game which is a roadblock to be solved. We required a sensor, VR board and a game engine for our project. For the Game Engine we chose unity. For the VR we chose Google's Cardboard VR and for sensor we choose a Movuino which a product of CRI developed by Kevin LHoste. We used some libraries in unity that are created for Movuino at CRI itself. So our final project is a puzzle based game for backpain that uses VR and Movuino.

##Week 2-4 

We made three levels for the game. We went ahead with our plans of the first week and completed a presentable game by 4-8-17.
We created three different environments and have three different positions for the movement. We got critical boundaries for the movements using the Movuino.
